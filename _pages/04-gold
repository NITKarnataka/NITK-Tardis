<h3>A magic beyond all</h3>
Music is the greatest liberator. Music makes one feel euphoric, electric and ecstatic. And to celebrate this feeling at the greatest party of all time, Bandish brings together the most gifted performers from around the country. Music surrounds as we sway to the gentle tunes of a melody or rock to the rhythmic beats of the number. One conciousness binds us, *Bandish*.

<h3>Order in chaos</h3>
The beach is easily the most inviting place in the whole world. To kick back and unwind after a tiring day, the waves breaking at ones feet and the sun setting in the distance, is the picture of blissful relaxation.  And when pumped up, a game of beach football or volleyball is the perfect pastime.  And enjoying this in the middle of one of India's largest fest along with pals and chums is the best feeling of them all. So slow down and look up at the scores of kites in the sky and chill out.

<h3>Art and expression find a place among all of us.</h3>
We are bursting with flair and brilliance and the most fitting place to blow the world away is at Incident. A meandering landscape or a delicate figurine, all finds a place at the _Kalakriti_ display at NITK. Promising talent in all fields is given a podium to stand up and speak for their ability. Photography, the art of capturing the most delicate moment from with a mountain of time, is placed at its fair place as aspiring paparazzo war to capture the essence of the occasion.

<h3>Romp and revel</h3>
It's a natural sensation to move one's body, to sway and waver, along with the rhythm.
The stage comes alive as footfalls thunder and the tempo catches pace. The eye feasts upon a plethora of steps and moves and the impeccable synchrony fills us with energy and vibe as the passion and the zeal of the dancers is transferred to the audience. Be it a romantic slow dance or a swift hip-hop, the audience becomes one with the performers and joins them to in the most profound expression of their mood, Dance.

<h3>Dazed reverie</h3>
The beauty of the art of performance can only be done justice by its worshippers. And Incident brings together the most awe-inspiring and mind-boggling array of artists conceivable. Whether it is Breathe the Floyd, whose enchanting music puts all in a stupor, or the melodious voice of Sunidhi Chauhan whose versatility is spellbinding, nothing rivets us more. And as the day wanes into the night, the music captivates and enthrals and one is finally at peace.

<h3>Mercenary of Death</h3>
There's a moment in your life when enough is just not enough. All you want is to lose yourself in a jungle of pure cacophony, where chaos is order and order chaos. For that day and that day only, Incident brings Pulse, where one may drown in the raw power of the music and yet breathe like never before. Losing oneself in the coarseness and pure crude metal is as easy as eating a pie, but getting back is the hard part.  So headbang and mosh till you can no longer feel the pain.

<h3>The spirit of the times.</h3>
Aptly exemplified by _Haute Couture_, a stage where the up and coming fashionistas display their skill and set new trends. A true sight for sore eyes as glamorous models in chic dresses struts and swaggers and leaves the world in their wake. Vogue will change as new rages and styles are the order of the day.
