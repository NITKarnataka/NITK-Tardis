<h3>Blending sports with culture</h3>
Years before the all-India tournaments would be conceived and championship
trophies be brought to Surathkal, sports became an integral part of the cultural
fest. Poolsplash, basketball and karate started to take centrestage, vying for space
with beautifully executed traditional dances and concerts. INCIDENT themes were
soon to fire common imagination, as the past merged seamlessly with the future.

body in college had a new goal- to push their limits and deliver the best on all
fronts.
